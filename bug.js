This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when using functional components with useState hook and making a synchronous call to the state variable before the component has fully mounted and the state is available.

**Example:**
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count); // This might log 'undefined'
    fetchCount();
  }, []);

  const fetchCount = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/count');
    const data = await response.json();
    setCount(data.count);
  };

  return (
    <div>{count}</div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
