To fix this, make sure the asynchronous operation and any access to the state variable occur only after the component has mounted and the state is initialized. The useEffect hook helps in this regard. You can leverage its dependency array to ensure the effect runs only after the initial render and state setting is complete.

**Corrected Example:**
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCount = async () => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      const response = await fetch('/api/count');
      const data = await response.json();
      setCount(data.count);
      setIsLoading(false);
    };

    fetchCount();
  }, []);

  if(isLoading){
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>{count}</div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
This revised version uses the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array to trigger the fetch only once after the component has mounted.  The addition of `isLoading` provides feedback to the user while waiting for data and prevents using the state before it is available.
